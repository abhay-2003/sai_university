    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>

    <p>This is my first paragraph. HTML is a markup language used to create web pages. It stands for HyperText Markup Language.</p>

    <p>Each paragraph in HTML is wrapped inside the &lt;p&gt; tag. This helps separate content and make it more readable.</p>

    <p>You can write about anything here â€“ your project, your hobbies, or even your resume summary!</p>
